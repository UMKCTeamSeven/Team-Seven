Iteration 3 stable build. 


Master branch is clear for testing. 

Iteration 4 starts tomorrow with a end date of the 24th , hopefully I'll have the tasks in and assigned around noon. 
Still a two week iteration, just starting it late. 

If you are on campus tomorrow I'll be around, come say hi if you need anything. 

Great job team,

Matt (ITR3 close)
