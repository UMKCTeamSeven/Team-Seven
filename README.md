# Team-Seven
Root level

https://desktop.github.com/ <---- A gui made by github, very easy to use and quick to learn. 
I use it unless I HAVE to use shell, if you like shell, more power to you.

I've created and merged a branch, to see how the final work flow should look you can see it illustrated:
https://github.com/UMKCTeamSeven/Team-Seven/network
as you go through these steps you can refersh this page after each sync completes to see how the graph changes. 




Try this workflow out :   

(If you have a different prefered workflow, go for it, that way I can see what it looks like) 

create a branch

add file to branch

commit

sync

switch to master and edit a different file (Once iteration starts we won't be doing this, just to simulate the workflow)

commit

sync

switch back to your branch

merge master into your branch

commit (You might not need to commit here)

sync

switch to master and edit a different file (same as before)

commit

sync

switch back to your branch

do a final change to your branch

commit

sync

send a pull request 


get onto github.com and navigate to this repo, look in pull requests,

(Your branch should have an auto merge option, if not, you did something wrong)

accept the pull request merging your branch to the master

delete your branch

It looks longer than it is ^^^
